# Analyze Death Age Difference of Left and Right Handers
# The project "Analyzing Age Differences in Death Between Right-Handed and Left-Handed Individuals" aims to investigate whether there are any significant differences in the ages at which right-handed and left-handed individuals pass away. The common belief that left-handed people have shorter lifespans will be examined using statistical analysis and data visualization techniques. The study explores the relationship between handedness and longevity by considering changing rates of left-handedness over time.
